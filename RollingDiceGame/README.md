In my quest to learn C# through building I created this game of computer guesses that dictate whether you won or lost.  

Using the Random.Next Method (System), the method generates random number 3 random numbers all between 1 and 6 to  
simulate rolling three different dice.  

If two of the dice rolls are the same you get two points for rolling doubles if all three are the same you get six  
bonus points for rolling tripples.  

The three dice roll results are then added. If the total is greater than 15 **YOU WIN!** Else **YOU LOSE!**
