This mini-project involves checking if a word is a palindrome or not.

**Algorithm to be implemented**
1. Get the length of the word and the ***mirrorline***, which in this case is the midpoint
   (**Word.Length**).
2. Compare the letters: the first letter of the word with the last using indices as you increment
   the index of the first letter towards the midpoint. While for the last letter decrement it towards the midpoint as you check equality of the letters in each iteration.
